# Deploy a single Hummingbot instance with Docker Compose

This installs a single [Hummingbot](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot) instance as a Docker container.

## Prerequisites

This configuration requires [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. The recommended way to get Docker Compose is to install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), which includes Docker Compose along with Docker Engine and Docker CLI which are Compose prerequisites.

Docker Desktop is available on:

* [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)
* [Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)
* [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)

## Installation

Clone this repo or copy the `docker-compose.yml` file to a directory on your machine where you want to store your Hummingbot files. This is where your encrypted keys, scripts, trades, and log files will be saved.

From that directory, run the following command to pull the image and start the instance:
```
docker-compose up -d
```

In Terminal/Bash, you should see the following output:
```
[+] Running 1/1
 â ¿ Container simple_hummingbot_compose-bot-1  Started 
 ```

After it has started, attach to the instance:
```
docker attach simple_hummingbot_compose-bot-1
```

If installation was successful, you should see the Hummingbot welcome screen:
