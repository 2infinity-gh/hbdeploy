# Deploy Hummingbot Instance

This installs a single [Hummingbot](https://github.com/hummingbot/hummingbot) instance as a Docker container.

## Prerequisites

This configuration requires [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/), a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. The recommended way to get Docker Compose is to install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/), which includes Docker Compose along with Docker Engine and Docker CLI which are Compose prerequisites.

See [Docker](../DOCKER.md) for more information about how to install and use Docker Compose, as well as helpful commands.

## Apple M1/M2 and other ARM machines

If you have a recent Mac that uses Apple Silicon (M1/M2) chipset or another ARM-based machine, you need to change the image tag to ensure that you pull a container that is optimized for your chip architecture. 

Use an IDE like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to edit the `docker-compose.yml` file. Change the the image tag from `latest` to `latest-arm` to pull the image built for ARM-based machines. You can also comment out the line that contains `latest` and uncomment the line that contains `latest-arm`:
```
# image: hummingbot/hummingbot:latest
image: hummingbot/hummingbot:latest-arm
```

Afterwards, save the file and proceed to the next step.

If you are using a Mac with an Intel (x86) chipset, Windows or any other Intel-based machine, you don't need to make any changes before deploying a container.

## Getting Started

In Terminal/Bash, run the following command to check that you have installed Docker Compose successfully:
```
docker compose
```

You should see a response that start with:
```
Usage:  docker compose [OPTIONS] COMMAND
```

### 1. Launch network

Clone this repo to your machine and go to the folder:
```
git clone https://github.com/hummingbot/deploy-examples.git
cd deploy-examples/simple_hummingbot_compose
```

Alternatively, copy the `docker-compose.yml` file to a directory on your machine where you want to store your Hummingbot files. 

This is the "root folder" where your encrypted keys, scripts, trades, configs, logs, and other files related to your bots will be saved.

From the root folder, run the following command to pull the image and start the instance:
```
docker compose up -d
```

After the images have been downloaded, you should see the following output:
```
[+] Running 1/1
 â ¿ Container hummingbot  Started 
 ```

### 2. Set permissions

Run this command from your root folder to grant read/write permission to the `hummingbot_files` sub-folder:
```
sudo chmod -R a+rw ./hummingbot_files
```

### 3. Launch Hummingbot

Attach to the `hummingbot` instance:
```
docker attach hummingbot
```

You should see the Hummingbot welcome screen:
